# Sponsored Products overview

Sponsored Products campaigns allow you to advertise your products in high-visibility placements on Amazon.com. Sponsored Products are available for vendors, sellers, and Kindle Direct Publishing authors.

You can use the Amazon Ads API to create and manage Sponsored Products campaigns, as well as retrieve campaign performance data. 

## Campaign management

>[TIP:New campaign management APIs]You can now manage campaigns across ad products using a common model and a single set of API endpoints. To get started with campaign management in the Amazon Ads API v1, see the [campaign management overview](guides/campaign-management/overview).

>[NOTE] The latest version of the Sponsored Products-specific campaign management endpoints is **version 3**. All reference documentation refers to the latest version. For more information on upgrading, see the version 2 to version 3 [migration guide](reference/migration-guides/sp-v2-v3).
