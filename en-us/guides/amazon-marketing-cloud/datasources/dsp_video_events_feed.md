# Amazon DSP video events table

**Analytics table:** 

* `dsp_video_events_feed`

**Audience table:** 

* `dsp_video_events_feed_for_audiences`


> [WARNING] Workflows that use these tables will time out when run over extended periods of time.

This table has the exact same basic structure as [dsp_impressions](guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_impressions) table but in addition to that, the table provides video metrics for each of the video creative events triggered by the video player and associated with the impression event.

The following table shows columns **in addition** to the ones listed for `dsp_impressions`.
