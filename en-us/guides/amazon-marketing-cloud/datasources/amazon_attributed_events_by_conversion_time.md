# Amazon attributed events

**Analytics table:**

- `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time`
- `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time`

**Audiences table:**

- `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time_for_audiences`
- `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time_for_audiences`


These tables both contain pairs of traffic and conversion events.

* "**Traffic events**" are impressions and clicks.
* "**Conversion events**" include purchases, various interactions with Amazon website, such as detailed page views and pixel fires.

Each conversion event in the table is attributed to its corresponding traffic event.

> [WARNING] While the tables include the same metrics and dimensions, they differ with respect to the set of events that are contained within.

In the `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time` table, the conversion events all happened within the time window the query is run over, while the traffic events the conversions were attributed to may happen up to 14 days before the time period for the query.

Below are some key elements of the logic that underpins Amazon demand-side platform (Amazon DSP) reporting. Note that this matches the business logic used to assemble the events for the `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time` table.

* Amazon DSP reports from the event perspective of the conversion event. The report date range corresponds to the time of conversion event, not time of impression event. Recommendation is to use:`amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time`.
* Amazon DSP will report out based on advertiser timezone, while AMC lets you customize the time zone that your query date range is applied in (defaults to UTC).

The `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time` table has the opposite behavior: the traffic events to which the conversion events are attributed all happened within the time window for the query, while the conversion events may have occurred up to 30 days after the time window.

When using the traffic time table, in order to correctly present conversion event details the time range for conversion events is automatically extended by 30 days after the end of the reporting window or the latest time for which conversion events data is available. This means that the output of a workflow that uses this table may change over time.

Itâ€™s important to note that these windows are not the same thing as an attribution window, as the attribution window is decided based on the campaign and cannot be changed in AMC.

These tables include data from multiple sources if your instance includes advertisers from multiple sources. For example, if you have Display, Sponsored Products, or Sponsored Brands advertisers in the instance, then conversions for both will appear in these tables. Currently, the column `ad_product_type `is the main way to filter these conversions, with a value of `sponsored_products` indicating sponsored products, `sponsored_display` indicating sponsored display, `sponsored_brands` indicating sponsored brands, and null indicating display. Filtering by campaign is also a viable option because campaigns will likely be unique to a table.

> [NOTE] All Sponsored Brands traffic events, including search terms and keywords, are available to query from `sponsored_ads_traffic` starting on December 2, 2022. Before this date, there are no Sponsored Brands traffic events in the table `sponsored_ads_traffic`.

The following keywords and search terms are available to query from the instance creation date (approximately*) or 13 months ago, whichever is sooner:

- Sponsored Products keywords and search terms from `sponsored_ads_traffic`
- Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products keywords and search terms from `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time `and `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time`

Please note that the exact dates will vary, depending on when the backfill period begins. Most instances that were created less than 13 months ago have data from 0-28 days before the instance creation date.

Modeled conversion events in the attributed conversion data sets are available through the above tables. Reporting grains below the ad line level are available for modeled conversion events, and instead reported as NULL. To exclude modeled conversions from insights, join attributed conversion data sets to user identifiers, traffic identifiers, or any dimension below the ad line level.

> [NOTE]  While non-addressable audiences appear as rows in tables where `user_id` is NULL, note that all rows with `user_id` as NULL are not modeled.

For each conversion record, this field indicates whether the conversion was attributed to an ad click. When querying this table, remember that each record represents a single conversion event that has been attributed to an ad view or click traffic event (and therefore this field will not represent the entirety of clicks generated by your campaigns). Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the conversion was attributed to an ad click event) or '0' (if the conversion was not attributed to ad click event).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NONE                  |

For on\-Amazon conversion events, this field contains human\-readable values, while off\-Amazon events measured via Events Manager are represented by numeric values. Possible values include: 'detailPageView', 'shoppingCart', 'order', 'searchConversion', 'brandStorePageView', 'wishList', 'babyRegistry', 'weddingRegistry', 'customerReview' for on\-Amazon events, and numeric values like '134', '140', '141' for off\-Amazon events.

Postal code is also referred to as "zip code" in the US. The postal code is prepended with the iso\_country\_code value (e.g. 'US'). If the country is known, but the postal code is unknown, only the country code will be populated in postal\_code. Example value: 'US\-12345'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | HIGH                  |

For example, if an impression served has a request\_tag value of 'X', related conversion events will have have an impression\_id value of 'X'. While this occurs infrequently, there are sometimes duplicate request\_tag values. As a result, it is not recommended to use request\_tag as a JOIN key without first grouping by it. Rather, it is a best practice to first consider using UNION ALL in a query instead of joining based on the request\_tag to combine data sources. For insights that involve user\-level ad exposure across tables, use user\_id instead.                                                                                                                                                                                      | VERY\_HIGH            |
