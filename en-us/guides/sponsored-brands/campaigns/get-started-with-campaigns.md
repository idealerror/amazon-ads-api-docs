# Getting started with campaigns

>[TIP:New campaign management APIs]This document describes using Sponsored Brands-specific APIs for campaign management. However, you can now manage campaigns across different ad products using a common model and a single set of API endpoints. To get started using the common campaign model in the Amazon Ads API v1, see the [campaign management overview](guides/campaign-management/overview).

## Before you begin

* Complete the Amazon Ads API [Onboarding](guides/onboarding/overview) and [Getting started](guides/get-started/overview) processes to obtain your access token and profile ID. You will need these to make all the calls referenced in the tutorial.
* Understand the structure of [Sponsored Brands campaigns](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/structure).


>[TIP] If you want to test out the creation flow for Sponsored Brands campaigns without worrying about ad spend, you can create a [Test account](guides/account-management/test-accounts/overview) and use it to complete this tutorial. 

### Step 1: Create a campaign

The first step is to create a campaign using the [POST /sb/v4/campaigns](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Campaigns/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsCampaigns) endpoint. 

Bidding strategies can be specified at the campaign level. Bidding can be done automatically by Amazon to optimize bids for [placements](https://advertising.amazon.com/help?ref_=AAC_unav_support_center#GYYZVM7LGSRYGWV5)other than top of search or by specifying a custom bidding adjustment. 

>[NOTE] If you are a seller and your brand has been approved, you must provide a `brandEntityId`. You can get the `brandEntityId` by calling the [GET /brands endpoint](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#tag/Brands/operation/getBrands)

#### Goal-based campaigns

Goal-based campaigns offer a streamlined campaign creation and management workflow to enhance your campaign performance. Each goal comes with a unique set of target and bid recommendations, designed to maximize success metrics and expand opportunities to display ads and reach potential customers on Amazon. 


**Parameters to create goal-based campaigns**

|Parameter	|Optional	|Description	|Default	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|goal	|No	|The goal type of the campaign. <br /> `BRAND_IMPRESSION_SHARE` - This goal will show your ads to shoppers searching for your brand. <br /> `PAGE_VISIT` - This goal drives traffic to your landing and detail pages through all placements.   |PAGE\_VISIT	  |
|costType	|No	|The costType can be set to determined how the campaign will bid and charge. To view the bid maximums and minimums by geography and costType, see https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/concepts/limits#bid-constraints-by-marketplace <br />CPC  - Cost per click. The performance of this campaign is measured by the clicks triggered by the ad. <br />VCPM - Cost per 1000 viewable impressions. The performance of this campaign is measured by the viewable impressions triggered by the ad.	|CPC	|
|smartDefault	|Yes	|The `smartDefault` parameter specifies a list of strategies for a campaign. Each element in smartDefault can be set to determine which default strategy to use.<br /> `MANUAL` - No default targeting is created. If `MANUAL` is added on the list, no other strategies are allowed on the list (the list must contains only one item). <br />`TARGETING` - Theme targeting is automatically created when creating an ad group.	|If no goal is present in request, `MANUAL` is set by default. If a goal is present, `TARGETING` is set by default. 	|

>[NOTE] Once an goal-based campaign is created, the `goal`, `costType`, and `smartDefault` values are not editable.

**Validation rules**

Both `goal` and `costType` parameters must be included in the request body in order to create an goal-based campaign. If the request body contains only one of these parameters, the response will return a validation error of `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Depending on the goal, either an goal-based campaign focused on brand impression or driving traffic to your landing page and detail page is created along with a set of target and bid recommendations to improve campaign performance.


|Goal type	|costType	|Result	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|Not included in request	|Not included in request	|Default goal type is PAGE_VISIT with a costType of CPC	|
|Not included in request	|Included in request	|INVALID_ARGUMENT error	|
|Included in request	|Not included in request	|INVALID_ARGUMENT error	|
|Included in request	|Included in request	|Creates a goal-based campaign	|

>[TIP] For optimized campaign performance, do **not** include any bidding optimizations (`bidOptimizationStrategy`, `bidAdjustmentsByShopperSegment`, `bidAdjustmentsByPlacement`, `bidOptimization`) when setting `smartDefault` to `TARGETING` or using a `costType` of `VCPM`.

**Sample request**

The `smartDefault` parameter with  `["TARGETING"]`  value automatically creates theme-based targeting based on the goal selected. In this example, the theme targeting is created with a focus on brand impression. 

```bash
curl --location 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/sb/v4/campaigns' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId: amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxx' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer Atza|xxxxxx' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope: xxxxxxx' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.sbcampaignresource.v4+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "campaigns": [
        {
            "budgetType": "DAILY",
            "name": "Goal-based campaign",
            "state": "ENABLED",
            "startDate": "2023-08-21",
            "budget": 10,
            "goal": "BRAND_IMPRESSION_SHARE",
            "costType": "VCPM",
            "smartDefault": ["TARGETING"]
        }
    ]
}'
```

For `goal` type `BRAND_IMPRESSION_SHARE`, only costType `VCPM` is available. If you try to use `costType` `CPC` for goal type `BRAND_IMPRESSION_SHARE`, the following error will occur:

```
 "errors": [
                    {
                        "errorType": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
                        "errorValue": {
                            "otherError": {
                                "cause": {
                                    "location": "$.goal"
                                },
                                "message": "Invalid goal type specified.",
                                "reason": "CAMPAIGN_GOAL_TYPE_INVALID"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
```

### Step 2: Create ad group

Create at least one ad group using the [POST /sb/v4/adGroups](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ad-Groups/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsAdGroups) endpoint. Use the `campaignId` returned in step 1 to create your ad group.

**Sample request**

This sample request creates ad ad group associated to one campaign. A successful call returns a `207` response code and indicates the `adGroupId` of the ad group created.


```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/sb/v4/adGroups' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId: amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer Atza|xxxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope: xxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.sbadgroupresource.v4+json' \
--data-raw '{
"adGroups": [{
    "campaignId": "{{campaignId}}",
    "name": "My ad group name",
    "state": "ENABLED"
}]
}
'
```

### Step 3: Upload and register assets

You can upload and register a video or image asset prior to creating an ad by using the [creative asset library API](guides/creative-asset/asset-library-overview).

### Step 4: Create an ad

Once you have the  `assetId`  from the previous step, you can create an ad. The ad types are product collection, video, brand video, and store spotlight. There has to be at least one ad in an ad group and an ad group cannot have more than one ad type.

To learn more about the requirements for each ad type, see:

* [Product collection](guides/sponsored-brands/ads/product-collection)
* [Video (including brand video)](guides/sponsored-brands/ads/video)
* [Store spotlight](guides/sponsored-brands/ads/store-spotlight)

**Ad restrictions when using a brand impression share goal**

If you create campaign with a goal of BRAND\_IMPRESSION\_SHARE, you must use one of the following creative types: 

- Product collection with a custom image and directing to a Store landing page 
- Store spotlight directing to a Store landing page
- Brand video ad pointing to a Store landing page

### Step 5: Add targeting to your ad group

Once youâ€™ve created an ad in an ad group, you need to add targeting. An ad group can be associated to either product or keyword targeting expressions.

* For keyword targeting, use the [POST /sb/keywords](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#tag/Keywords/operation/createKeywords) endpoint.
* For product targeting, use the [POST /sb/targets](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#tag/Product-targeting/operation/createTargets) endpoint.
* For theme targeting, use the [POST /sb/themes](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#tag/Theme-targeting/operation/sbCreateThemes) endpoint

### Step 6: Check the moderation status

You can check the moderation status of your ads by passing the `adId` as the `id` in the [Moderation API](moderation).


### Step 7: Make any changes to your ads or creatives

Based on the moderation status, you may need to make changes to your ad or creative. See [Managing assets](guides/creative-asset/managing-assets) and [Managing campaigns](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/managing-multi-ad-group-campaigns) for more details.
