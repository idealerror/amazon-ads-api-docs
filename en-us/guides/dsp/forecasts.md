# Forecasting API (beta)

Amazon Ads has launched a new forecasting API for Amazon DSP (ADSP) campaigns. Built on the [Amazon Ads data model](reference/amazon-ads/overview), this API provides access to all real-time forecasts currently available on ADSP Campaign Manager.

The API currently supports campaign-level performance, delivery, and spend forecasts currently available on forecasting widgets. This includes campaign flight level forecasts for spend, reach, CPC, CPA, and ROAS. The API provides forecasts both for new orders and existing orders that are spending budget.

Throughout 2025, we will expand the capabilities of the API to include forecasts for other features on the campaign manager such as line-level forecasts, additional spend potential, and creative forecasts. These metrics will also be available using datasets through Amazon Marketing Cloud for easier integrations.
