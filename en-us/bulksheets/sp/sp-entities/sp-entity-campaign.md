| 11     | Bidding Strategy        | Advertisers can now select from three Sponsored Products campaign bidding strategies. These strategies are designed to offer advertisers more control and help improve performance. When advertisers select one of the two available “dynamic bidding” options as their campaign bidding strategy Amazon will adjust their bids in real time, based on the likelihood of conversion. When advertisers select “fixed bids” as their campaign bidding strategy Amazon will use their exact bids for all eligible opportunities, and will not adjust bids based on likelihood of a conversion. | Required                   | Enter “Fixed Bids”, “Dynamic bidding (up and down)”, or “Dynamic bidding (down only)” <br/> <br/> See the section [Dynamic Bidding Strategy Options](bulksheets/sp/sp-general-info/sp-dynamic-bidding-strategy) for the details on each strategy. | Yes     |
