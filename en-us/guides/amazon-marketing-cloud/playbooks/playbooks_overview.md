# What are AMC Playbooks?

Playbooks are intended to accelerate specific marketing use cases leveraging Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) data. The examples provided in the playbooks are based on a real-life use case, but are illustrative in nature. Each playbook lists the strategical and tactical perspective to achieve desired results.

These playbooks include a combination of adtech strategy, code (SQL & Python), and data visualizations to intimately describe how and why each use case creates value-generating actions from AMC.
