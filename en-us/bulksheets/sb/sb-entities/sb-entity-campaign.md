| 20     | Automated Bidding   | By using automated bidding, you allow Amazon to optimize your bids for placements other than top of search. The keyword bids you provide apply to top of search and are used as a maximum starting point for other placements. Amazon may then decrease your bids for other placements based on your observed conversion rate for those placements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Required for submitting for review.

| 21     | Bid Multiplier      | Instead of choosing the Automated Bidding option for placements other than top of search, advertisers can set a custom bid adjustment for these placements. For example, a -40% Bid Multiplier on a $5.00 bid will become $3.00. When Automated Bidding is "enabled", Bid Multiplier should be empty or "+0.00%"/"-0.00%".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Required if automated bidding is disabled.
