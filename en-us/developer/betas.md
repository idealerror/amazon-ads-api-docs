## FAQ

### Who are these betas for?

Betas in the Ads API v1 are intended for Amazon Ads API developers who are interested in providing feedback on the new consistent models and API structure. These betas may be beneficial for developers integrating across multiple Amazon Ads products now or in the future. During the beta period, breaking changes may occur to address any customer feedback regarding naming, structure, or format.

We refer to betas as _closed_ or _open_. Closed betas are invite-only and are often the first phase of a beta. Open betas are accessible to developers without an invite, and often occur as a second phase to test scale.

### How can I join a closed beta?

For resources noted as "closed beta," please review the API description to find information about how to submit a request to join a given beta program. Once you are accepted into a beta program, your client ID can be added to the allowlist for the resource. 

Your client ID for a closed beta will be the same as the [Login With Amazon application created during the onboarding process](guides/onboarding/create-lwa-app#retrieve-your-security-credentials). If you have an existing integration with the Amazon Ads API, this will be the same client ID you currently use to authorize requests to the API. You do _not_ need a new client ID to access beta functionality.

### What do we need from you during the beta?

We encourage beta participants to:

- Provide feedback on the new API models and structure.
- Identify any regressions compared to their current API experience.
- Conduct test calls during the first phase of the beta.
- Perform scale testing in the second phase of the beta.

Your input will help us refine the Ads API v1 to best meet the needs of Amazon Ads developers. [You can submit feedback to our team via Jira](https://amzn-clicks.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/2/create/6).
