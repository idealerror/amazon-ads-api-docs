# Sponsored Products product targeting recommendations

If you donâ€™t know what products to target, Amazon can recommend products based on the ASINs you are advertising. 

## Request

>[TIP] If you are including multiple ASINs in the request, make sure they are similar products. The response includes suggested products for **all** ASINs included in the request.

You can either request recommendations by theme or by ASIN. Recommendations by theme returns a list of themes (for example, similar items or complementary items). Each theme includes a list of ASINs that fall into that category. Recommendations by ASIN returns a list of ASINs. Each ASIN includes an explanation of what theme it matches. See the examples below for more information. The type of response is determined by the value of the Accept header.
