# Developer guides overview

Amazon Ads provides a number of advanced tools that give developers the ability to programatically create and manage campaigns, as well as retrieve performance data.

>[TIP:Documentation translations]Translations of these developer guides are available in select languages. For a list of available languages, see [Translations](guides/translations).

## Use cases

### Onboarding

To use all developer tools, you must first complete the onboarding process which includes registering an application and applying for access to the API.

### Reporting & measurement

Developers can use the Amazon Ads API and Amazon Marketing Stream to access performance metrics for Amazon Ads campaigns.

The Ads API supports asynchronous report requests, while Amazon Marketing Stream provides near real-time access to metrics through your AWS account.
