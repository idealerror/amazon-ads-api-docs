# Conversions with relevance

**Analytics table:** 

* `conversions_with_relevance`

**Audience table:** 

* `conversions_with_relevance_for_audiences`

The data sources `conversions` and `conversions_with_relevance` are used to create custom attribution models both for ASIN conversions (purchases) and pixel conversions.

ASIN conversions tracked on Amazon Ad Server for advertisers or campaigns are available in the above tables. Customers who sell products on Amazon can use these signals to run attribution queries to evaluate impact of off-Amazon media on their Amazon conversions.
To improve advertiser experience and simplify the query process, `conversions` and `conversions_with_relevance` tables are updated to contain signals related to ad-attributed and pixel conversions only, saving advertisersâ€™ time and efforts to build dedicated queries to achieve the same outcome by removing non-ad attributed conversions from the tables.

| event\_category | STRING | DIMENSION | For ASIN conversions, the event\_category is the high level category of the conversion event, either 'purchase' or 'website'. Examples of ASIN conversions when event\_category = 'website' include: detail page views, add to wishlist, or the first Subscribe and Save order. For search conversions (when event\_subtype = 'searchConversion'), the event\_category is always 'website'. For pixel conversions, this field is always 'pixel'. | LOW |

| event\_subtype | STRING | DIMENSION | Subtype of the conversion event. This field provides additional detail about the subtype of conversion event that occurred, such as whether it represents viewing a product's detail page on Amazon.com or completing a purchase on an advertiser's website. For on-Amazon conversion events, this field contains human-readable values, while off-Amazon events measured via Events Manager are represented by numeric values. Possible values include: 'detailPageView', 'shoppingCart', 'order', 'searchConversion', 'brandStorePageView', 'wishList', 'babyRegistry', 'weddingRegistry', 'customerReview' for on-Amazon events, and numeric values like '134', '140', '141' for off-Amazon events. For more information on off-Amazon conversion event subtypes, refer to the "Introduction to Events Manager" entry in the IQL. | LOW |
| event\_type | STRING | DIMENSION | Always 'CONVERSION' in the data sources conversions and conversions\_with\_relevance. | LOW |
| event\_type\_class | STRING | DIMENSION | For ASIN conversions, the event\_type\_class is the high level classification of the event type, e.g. consideration, conversion, etc. This field will be blank for pixel conversions (when event\_category = 'pixel') and search conversions (when event\_subtype = 'searchConversion'). | LOW |
| event\_type\_description | STRING | DIMENSION | Human-readable description of the conversion event. For ASIN conversions, examples include: 'add to baby registry', 'Add to Shopping Cart', 'add to wedding registry', 'add to wishlist', 'Customer Reviews Page', 'New SnS Subscription', 'Product detail page viewed', 'Product purchased'. This field will be blank for search conversions (when event\_subtype = 'searchConversion'). For pixel conversions (when event\_category = 'pixel'), the event\_type\_description will include additional information about the pixel based on information provided as part of the campaign setup, such as 'Homepage visit', 'Add to Shopping Cart' or 'Brand store engagement 2'. Before using these fields to evaluate pixel conversions, we recommend that you consult with the team that set up the advertiser's campaign to determine how the event\_type\_description values for pixel conversions should be interpreted. | LOW |
| halo\_code | STRING | DIMENSION | The halo code between the campaign and conversion. Possible values for this column are TRACKED\_ASIN, VARIATIONAL\_ASIN, BRAND\_KEYWORD, CATEGORY\_KEYWORD, BRAND\_MARKETPLACE, BRAND\_GL\_PRODUCT, BRAND\_CATEGORY, BRAND\_SUBCATEGORY, and null. See also the definition for engagement\_scope. The halo\_code will be NULL for pixel conversions (when event\_category = 'pixel'). | LOW |

| tracked\_asin | STRING | DIMENSION | The dimension tracked\_asin is the tracked Amazon Standard Identification Number, which is either the promoted or brand halo ASIN. When the tracked\_item results in a purchase conversion, the tracked\_asin will be populated in this column, in addition to being tracked in the tracked\_item column with the same ASIN value. The tracked\_asin is populated only if the event\_category = 'purchase'. For the first SnS order and non-purchase conversions, such as detail page views, the ASIN is populated under tracked\_item. See also 'tracked\_item'. | LOW |
