# Step 2: Apply for Amazon Ads API access

Create LwA client](guides/onboarding/create-lwa-app) | [**2\. Apply for API access**](guides/onboarding/apply-for-access) | [3\. Assign access](guides/onboarding/assign-api-access)</span></div>

Now that you have [created an Amazon Developer account and a Login with Amazon application](guides/onboarding/create-lwa-app), the next step is to apply for access to the Amazon Ads API.

How you apply for access will depend upon how your company intends to use the API. First, determine which of these categories best describes your business:

- **Partner** : Businesses that build applications and software solutions to automate and help optimize advertising on behalf of others can access the Amazon Ads API as a third party.
- **Direct Advertiser** : Advertisers that use the Amazon Ads API to automate, scale, and optimize advertising activities and reporting.

## To apply for API access as a Partner

Partners will apply for API access through the [Amazon Ads Partner Network](https://advertising.amazon.com/partners/network), a self-service hub for agencies and tool providers to manage their business relationships with Amazon Ads. If your company has not registered for the Amazon Ads Partner Network, please do so by following the link above.

>[NOTE] Registration for API access is just one aspect of the Amazon Ads Partner Network. Please register using an email address that can be managed by the appropriate members of your organization, which may or may not be the address used to create an Amazon Developer account and Login with Amazon client in [step 1](guides/onboarding/create-lwa-app). Approved partners will be able to assign their API access to an LwA client in a later step.

Once you (i) are approved for API access and (ii) have assigned scope to the LwA application, then it will be linked to your Partner Network account. Until then, it will stay in a pending state once requested. See [Next steps](#next-steps) for further details on scope assignment, etc. | ![Screenshot of Partner Network application form](/_images/setting-up/partner-network-form.png) |
