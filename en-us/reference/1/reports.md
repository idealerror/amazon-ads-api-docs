# Reports

Use the `requestReport` operation to retrieve performance reports. There are multiple ways to retrieve your campaign data, and using reports may not always be the most efficient way. If you are trying to download a record of your campaign structure and all of its entities (like AdGroups, keywords, productAds), we recommended that you run a snapshot of your entities instead of requesting a list of all elements in the campaign. For more information, see [snapshots](sponsored-products/2-0/openapi#tag/Snapshots).

**Note:** When generating a report (POST), there are separate endpoints for ad types Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands reports. These endpoints are specified at the beginning of each section. When retrieving the report ID and downloading the report (GET), it is not necessary to differentiate the endpoints based on the ad type.

The following table describes the service behavior in terms of the URL space and HTTP methods supported by the service-managed resources.

| Method | URL                  | Use Case                                                                                             |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/{recordType}/report` | Request the creation of a performance report for all entities of a single type which have performance data to report. |
| GET    | `/reports/{reportId}`  | Retrieve status, metadata and location of a previously requested performance report.                 |

## Operations

### requestReport

```shell

#### Parameters

| Parameter Name | Type   | Specified In | Description                    |
|----------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|

#### Response

| Status Code            | Response object |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| `200 - success`          | [`ReportResponse`](#ReportResponse)     |
| `401 - unauthorized`     | [`Error`](#Error)           |

| `404 - not found server` | [`Error`](#Error)           |

The [`ReportResponse`](#ReportResponse) will contain report status. When the report has
completed, the location field will provide a redirect URL for the
gzipped file containing the report. See [downloading reports](sponsored-products/2-0/openapi#/Reports/getReport) for more details.

## Valid report requests

Report requests will return a 422 if the parameters specified are
unrecognized or if the combination of parameters is not supported. In
particular, the choice of `recordType` may restrict the use of certain
segments. Query segmentation can only be used in combination with
keyword reports.

If you are receiving '404 - Not Found Server' errors, check that you have the input the `entityType` endpoint correctly. must be one of: `campaigns`, `adGroups`, `keywords`, `asins`, or `productAds`

## Resource representations

### ReportResponse

```JSON
{
    "title": "ReportResponse",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {   
      "reportId": {
           "description": "The ID of the report that was requested.",
           "type": "string"
       },
      "recordType": {
           "description": "The record type of the report. It can be campaigns, adGroups, productAds or keywords.",
           "type": "string"
       },
       "status": {
           "description": "The status of the generation of the report, it can be IN_PROGRESS, SUCCESS or FAILURE.",
           "type": "string"
       },
       "statusDetails": {
           "description": "Description of the status.",
           "type": "string"
       },
       "location": {
           "description": "The URI from the API service from which a redirect to the report can be found. It's only available if status is SUCCESS.",
           "type": "string"
       },
       "fileSize": {
           "description": "The size of the report file in bytes. It's only available if status is SUCCESS.",
           "type": "number"
       }
    }
}
```

### Error

See [error object return](reference/concepts/developer-notes) format as described in Developer notes.

## Report file format

The report file contains one row per entity for which performance data
is present. These records are represented as JSON containing the ID
attribute corresponding to the `recordType`, the segment (if specified),
and each of the metrics in the request.

For example, a report requested with the following call:

```shell
POST /keywords/report                

 {                                     

 "campaignType": "sponsoredProducts",  
 "segment":"query",                    
 "reportDate":"20180310",              
 "metrics":"impressions,clicks"        

 }                                     |
```

Would have a report that looks something like this:

```shell
[                                                                                           
 {"keywordId":123, "query": "red iphone case", "impressions": 584920, "clicks": 2989},         
 {"keywordId":123, "query": "blue iphone 6s case", "impressions": 8348230, "clicks": 16483},   
 {"keywordId":456, "query": "chuck taylor all star", "impressions": 83910, "clicks": 2483},    
 {"keywordId":456, "query": "converse chuck taylor", "impressions": 2349190, "clicks": 1238},  
 {"keywordId":456, "query": "chuck taylor", "impressions": 291827, "clicks": 1289},            
 {"keywordId":789, "query": "rare earth magnets", "impressions": 99375092, "clicks": 912037},  
 {"keywordId":789, "query": "magnets", "impressions": 93894023, "clicks": 238482},             
 {"keywordId":789, "query": "strong magnets", "impressions": 292, "clicks": 1}                 
]
```

## Downloading reports

When reports have completed, the location field will provide a URI for
the download action against the generated report. Note that requests
against this URI require authentication, so the authorization header
must be passed. The response to these requests will not contain a body
and will return a 307 redirect with the location header populated with
an S3 file location. The resulting file location is short lived (expires
in 30 seconds). If this time elapses before a client is able to begin
downloading the file, the client may make another request against the
download action URI.

**Note that the report file in S3 is gzipped.**

### Sponsored Brands reporting

Sponsored Brands (SB) (formerly known as Headline Search Ads) are a type of ad product with different characteristics and page
placement options from those of Sponsored Products. The Sponsored brands reporting feature is designed to deliver reporting
information only for SB campaigns via the API. To create or modify SB
ads and campaigns, continue to use the web interface. The object
that differentiates between Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands is the `campaignType` object.

#### Reporting endpoints

Sponsored Brands reporting data is only available from the following endpoints:

- `/v1/campaigns/report`
- `/v1/adGroups/report`
- `/v1/keywords/report`

#### Constraints of Sponsored Brands reporting

Sponsored Brands reporting data cannot be combined with Sponspored Products data into
one report. Use `headlineSearch` for the `campaignType` to retrieve
reporting data for SB campaigns. Only 14-day data is available for SB.
Attribution windows of 1, 7, and 30-day intervals are not available. For
Sponsored Brands, query segmentation or search-term reporting is not supported.

> **Note:** Mock data is used in the sandbox test environment provided,
> and additional report intervals besides 14-day may be available in the
> sandbox only. Production environment enforces that only 14-day sales
> reporting data is available.

#### New reporting fields with Sponsored Brands

Reporting for SB adds the following fields:

| Report type | New fields                                                                                                       |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Campaign    | `campaignType`, `campaignBudget`, `campaignBudgetType`, and `campaignStatus`                                             |
