# Product collection

With the product collection ad type, you can promote your products from a landing page of your choice. This ad features your brand logo, a custom headline, and three or more products. When Amazon shoppers click a product's image, it takes them to the product detail page. Clicking the brand logo or the headline, directs shoppers to your store or a custom landing page that you designate.

See the [API reference](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsProductCollectionAds) for more details.

## Before you begin

You must have the following before creating a product collection ad:

* An `assetId` for any creatives being used in the ad:
    * custom image (optional)
    * brand logo (required) requires minimum dimensions of 400 x 400 px
    * These IDs are created using the [asset library API](guides/creative-asset/asset-library-overview).
* [An ad group ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#step-2-create-ad-group)
* [A campaign ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#step-1-create-a-campaign)
* Three eligible ASINs to show in the ad
* A headline for the ad
* The brand name you want to appear on the ad

        }
    }]
}'
```



### Custom URL

If you are a vendor and you have a custom landing page, you can set `pageType` to `CUSTOM_URL`. The landing page must include the ASINs of at least three products that are advertised as part of the campaign.

>[NOTE] Only vendors can use the `CUSTOM_URL` enum. This `pageType` is not available for sellers.  

**Example request body: CUSTOM_URL**


```json
curl --location 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/sb/v4/ads/productCollectionExtended' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId: amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxx' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope: xxxxxxx' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.sbadresource.v4+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{

        "url": "https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/xxxxxx"

        "headline": "The headline text of the products in the ad"
    }
}]
}'
```

### Custom image

To add a custom image, you must first get an `assetId` using the [asset library API](guides/creative-asset/asset-library-overview). Within the creative object, you can specify the dimensions of the custom image. If you do not specify dimensions, the custom image will default to an image size of 1200 x 628 px.

>[NOTE] A custom image is optional and not required for the creation of a product collection ad. 

**Request example with custom image crop dimensions:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should we add a custom image? What are the benefits of using a custom image?

Historical data shows that, on average, Sponsored Brands ads with a branded creative generates a 50% increase in CTR and a 60% increase in branded search compared to ads with only product images.


### What are branded creatives? Is product collection with a custom image or Lifestyle considered a branded creative?

Yes, product collection with a custom image (also known as a Lifestyle image) is considered a branded creative. product collection without a custom image is not considered a branded creative.


### What is the visual difference between a product collection ASIN-only creative and a product collection custom image creative?

The main difference between a product collection ASIN-only creative and a product collection custom image is the presence of the custom image. A product collection custom image ad may contain zero or one products, but an ASIN-only ad with zero or one product does not display on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).


### How can I identify campaigns with no custom images?

You can use the existing POST API [/sb/v4/ads/list](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/ListSponsoredBrandsAds) to identify if your creative is missing a custom image or not. This API returns the latest creative status, including if the moderation is pending or rejected.


### What should I do when my creative is under moderation review?

If your creative is under moderation review, please wait until the moderation is completed. In case your creative is rejected due to ad policy violation, you can edit your creative using the POST API [/sb/ads/creatives/productCollection](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ad-creatives/operation/CreateProductCollectionCreative).


### We are not integrated with creative edit features. How can we edit product collection ads using ad console?

Please follow the instructions in this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHIhQ419Vw).


### What if I donât have a suitable custom image?

For existing campaigns, we recommend that you edit your campaign to include a custom image from your computer, asset library, or, if available to you, create a GenAI image using the beta feature found at [image generation](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-us/resources/whats-new/image-generation-for-sponsored-brands?ref_=pe_37211531_889230061). If your existing campaign links to your Store landing page, then Amazon Ads can generate an image from your Store in your ASIN-only product collection ads if applicable. Additionally, you can build a Sponsored Brands video ad if you have video assets or a Store spotlight ad if you have a Store.

Please reach out to us in the [Amazon Ads API Service Desk](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/support/overview) for more information on how to use Gen AI through APIs.


### Do I have to upload one custom image per ASIN in the product collection?

No, you need one custom image per product collection ad. product collection ads allow you to promote your products from a landing page of your choice. These ads feature your brand logo, a custom headline, and three or more products. When Amazon customers click a productâs image, it takes them to the product detail page. Clicking the brand logo or the headline will direct customers to your Store or a custom landing page. For product collection, you will need a minimum of three products.
