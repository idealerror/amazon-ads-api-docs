# Record Type: Keywords

As shown in Sponsored Product Entity Hierarchy, for auto Sponsored Products campaigns, i.e. campaigns with Campaign Targeting Type “Auto”, the only keyword that can be created are campaign level negative keywords. As a result, Record Type Keyword is required for manually-targeted campaigns only; for campaigns using auto targeting, you can either skip this step or use it for creating campaign level negative keywords.
