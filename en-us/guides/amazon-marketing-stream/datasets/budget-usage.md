## Data freshness

Amazon Marketing Stream pushes budget usage updates in near real-time. You should receive a notification soon after your budget usage increases 5%. Due to Amazonâ€™s traffic validation process, it is possible that you may receive the same notification twice. For example, if a click is invalidated, that may reduce your budget usage under the 5% threshold.
