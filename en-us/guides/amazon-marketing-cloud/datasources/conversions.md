# Conversions table

**Analytics table:** 

* `conversions`

**Audience table:** 

* `conversions_for_audiences`

The conversions table contains AMC conversion events. Ad-attributed conversions for ASINs tracked to an Amazon DSP or sponsored ads campaigns and pixel conversions are included. Conversions are ad-attributed if a user was served a traffic event within the 28-day period prior to the conversion event.

| Name | Data type | Metric/dimension | Description | Aggregation threshold |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| combined\_sales | DECIMAL(38,4) | METRIC | Sum of total\_product\_sales+off\_Amazon\_product\_sales | NONE |
| conversion\_event\_name | STRING | DIMENSION | The advertiser's name of the conversion definition. | LOW |
| conversion\_event\_source\_name | STRING | DIMENSION | The source of the advertiser-provided conversion data. | LOW |
| conversion\_id | STRING | DIMENSION | Unique identifier of the conversion event. In the conversions table, each row has a unique conversion\_id value. | VERY\_HIGH |
| conversions | LONG | METRIC | The count of conversion events. This field always contains a value of 1, allowing you to calculate conversion totals for the records selected in your query. Conversion events can include on-Amazon activities like purchases and detail page views, as well as off-Amazon events measured through Events Manager. Possible values for this field are: '1' (the record represents a conversion event). | NONE |
| event\_category | STRING | DIMENSION | High-level category of the conversion event. For ASIN conversions, this categorizes whether the event was a purchase or website browsing interaction. Website events include activities like detail page views, add to wishlist actions, and first Subscribe and Save orders. For conversions measured through Events Manager, this field is always 'off-Amazon'. Possible values include: 'purchase', 'website', and 'off-Amazon'. | LOW |
| event\_date\_utc | DATE | DIMENSION | Date of the conversion event in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timezone. Example value: '2025-01-01'. | LOW |
| event\_day\_utc | INTEGER | DIMENSION | Day of month when the conversion event occurred in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example value: '1'. | LOW |
| event\_dt\_hour\_utc | TIMESTAMP | DIMENSION | Timestamp of the conversion event in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) truncated to hour. Example value: '2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'. | LOW |
| event\_dt\_utc | TIMESTAMP | DIMENSION | Timestamp of the conversion event in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example value: '2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'. | MEDIUM |
| event\_hour\_utc | INTEGER | DIMENSION | Hour of the day (0-23) when the conversion event occurred in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timezone. Example value: '0'. | LOW |
| event\_subtype | STRING | DIMENSION | Subtype of the conversion event. This field provides additional detail about the subtype of conversion event that occurred, such as whether it represents viewing a product's detail page on Amazon.com or completing a purchase on an advertiser's website. For on-Amazon conversion events, this field contains human-readable values, while off-Amazon events measured via Events Manager are represented by numeric values. Possible values include: 'detailPageView', 'shoppingCart', 'order', 'searchConversion', 'brandStorePageView', 'wishList', 'babyRegistry', 'weddingRegistry', 'customerReview' for on-Amazon events, and numeric values like '134', '140', '141' for off-Amazon events. For more information on off-Amazon conversion event subtypes, refer to the "Introduction to Events Manager" entry in the IQL. | LOW |
| event\_type | STRING | DIMENSION | Type of conversion event. Conversion events in AMC can include both on-Amazon events (like purchases and detail page views) and off-Amazon events (like website visits and app installs measured through Events Manager). This field will always have a value of 'CONVERSION'. | LOW |
| event\_type\_class | STRING | DIMENSION | Classification of conversion events based on customer behavior. This field categorizes conversion events into consideration events (like detail page views) versus actual conversion events (like purchases). Possible values include: 'consideration', 'conversion', and NULL. | LOW |
| event\_type\_description | STRING | DIMENSION | Human-readable description of the conversion event type. Conversion events can occur on Amazon (like product purchases or detail page views) or off Amazon (like brand site page views or in-store transactions measured via Events Manager). Example values: 'Product purchased', 'Add to Shopping Cart', 'Product detail page viewed'. | LOW |
| marketplace\_name | STRING | DIMENSION | Name of the marketplace where the conversion event occurred. A marketplace can be an online shopping site (like Amazon.com) or a physical retail location (like Amazon Fresh stores). This field helps distinguish between conversions that happen on different Amazon online marketplaces versus those that occur in Amazon's physical retail locations. Example values include: 'AMAZON.COM', 'AMAZON.CO.UK', 'WHOLE\_FOODS\_MARKET\_US', and 'AMAZON\_FRESH\_STORES\_US'. | LOW |
| new\_to\_brand | BOOLEAN | DIMENSION | Boolean value indicating whether the customer associated with a purchase event is new-to-brand. A customer is considered new-to-brand if they have not purchased from the brand in the previous 12 months. This field is only applicable for purchase events. Possible values for this field are: 'true', 'false'. | LOW |
| no\_3p\_trackers | BOOLEAN | DIMENSION | Boolean value indicating whether the event can be used for audience creation that is third-party tracking enabled (i.e. whether you can serve creative with third-party tracking when running media against the audience). Third-party tracking refers to measurement tags and pixels from external vendors that can be used to measure ad performance. Possible values for this field are: 'true', 'false'. | NONE |
| off\_amazon\_conversion\_value | DECIMAL(38,4) | METRIC | Non monetary "value" of conversion for non-purchase conversions | NONE |
| off\_amazon\_product\_sales | DECIMAL(38,4) | METRIC | "Value" of purchase conversions provided via Conversion Builder | NONE |
| purchase\_currency | STRING | DIMENSION | ISO currency code of the purchase. Currency codes follow the ISO 4217 standard for representing currencies (e.g., USD for US Dollar). Example value: 'USD'. | LOW |
| purchase\_retail\_program | STRING | DIMENSION | Retail program through which the on-Amazon purchase event occurred, including online and in-store purchases through Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market, and Amazon Fresh. Possible values include: 'Amazon.com', 'Amazon Fresh', and 'Whole Foods Market'. | LOW |
| purchase\_unit\_price | DECIMAL(38,4) | METRIC | The unit price of the product sold for on-Amazon purchase events, in local currency. This field represents the price per individual unit, not the total purchase price which may include multiple units. Example value: '29.99'. | NONE |
| total\_product\_sales | DECIMAL(38,4) | METRIC | Product sales (in local currency) for on-Amazon purchase events. Example value: '12.99'. | NONE |
| total\_units\_sold | LONG | METRIC | Units sold for on-Amazon purchase events. Example value: '3'. | NONE |
| tracked\_asin | STRING | DIMENSION | The ASIN of the conversion event. An ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is a unique 10-character identifier assigned to products sold on Amazon. ASINs that appear in this field were either directly promoted by the campaign or are products from the same brand as the promoted ASINs. This field will only be for on-Amazon purchases (event\_category = 'purchase'); for other conversion types, this field will be NULL. When this field is populated, tracked\_item will have the same value. Example value: 'B01234ABCD'. | LOW |
| tracked\_item | STRING | DIMENSION | Identifier for the conversion event item. The value in this field depends on the subtype of the conversion event. For ASIN-related conversions on Amazon such as purchases, detail page views, add to cart events, this field will contain the ASIN of the product. For brand store events, this field will contain the brand store ID. For branded search conversions on Amazon, this field will contain the ad-attributed branded search keyword. For off-Amazon conversions, this field will contain the ID of the conversion definition. Note that when tracked\_asin is populated, the same value will appear in tracked\_item. | LOW |
| user\_id | STRING | DIMENSION | Pseudonymous identifier that connects user activity across different events. The field can contain ad user IDs (representing Amazon accounts), device IDs, or browser IDs. NULL values appear when Amazon Ads is unable to resolve an identifier for an event. The field has a VERY\_HIGH aggregation threshold, meaning it cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used within Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for aggregation purposes like COUNT(DISTINCT user\_id). | VERY\_HIGH |
| user\_id\_type | STRING | DIMENSION | Type of user ID value. AMC includes different types of user ID values, depending on whether the value represents a resolved Amazon account, a device, or a browser cookie. If Amazon Ads is unable to determine or provide an ID of any kind for a conversion event, the 'user\_id' and 'user\_id\_type' values for that record will be NULL. Possible values include: 'adUserId', 'sisDeviceId', 'adBrowserId', and NULL. | LOW |
