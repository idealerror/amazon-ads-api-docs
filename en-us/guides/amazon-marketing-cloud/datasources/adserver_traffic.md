> [NOTE] Amazon Ad Server was sunset in Q4 2024, please visit [this page](https://support.sizmek.com/hc/en-us/articles/21193881095565-AAS-offboarding-package) (AAS offboarding information) for offboarding support resources and sunset FAQs.

## adserver\_traffic

The data source `adserver_traffic` includes impressions, clicks and interactions (video and view-ability) from integrations with Search advertising platforms measured by the Amazon Ad Server.
Events that were measured using Amazon Ad Server placements tags on Amazon DSP have a request\_tag. The request\_tag is a unique token that is similar to (and joins with) the request\_tag in the dsp\_impressions data source. The request\_tag can be used as a join key to enrich adserver events with DSP data, such as bidding costs and other parameters that are native to the Amazon DSP, but not directly accessible on adserver events
Use this data source to gain insights about your Amazon Ad Server measured media. You can query this data source only if you have ad server campaigns and have completed Amazon Ad Server - AMC onboarding.

As such, ‘request\_tag’ can be used as join key to  enrich Amazon Ad Server events with Amazon DSP properties for similar  impression in dsp\_impressions data set. It can also be used for deduplicating  impression and click data across adserver and non adserver data sets.
