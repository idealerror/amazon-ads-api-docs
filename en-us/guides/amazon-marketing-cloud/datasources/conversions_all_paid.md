# Conversions all

**Analytics table:** 

* `conversions_all`

**Audience table:** 

* `conversions_all_for_audiences`

Contains both ad-exposed and non-ad-exposed conversions for tracked ASINs. Conversions are ad-exposed if a user was served a traffic event within the 28-day period prior to the conversion event.

In the custom attribution dataset, the tracked\_item is the identifier of an item of interest for the campaign, such as the ASIN tracked to the campaign, the brand halo ASIN, or the ad\-attributed branded keyword\. Attribution algorithms match traffic and conversion event by the user identity and tracked item\. Matching rules for tracked items may include expansion algorithms such as brand halo when the conversions\_with\_relevance dataset is used\.
