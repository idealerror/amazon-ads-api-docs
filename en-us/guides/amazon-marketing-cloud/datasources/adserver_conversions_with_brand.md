# Amazon Ad Server conversions with brand

> [NOTE] Amazon Ad Server was sunset in Q4 2024, please visit [this page](https://support.sizmek.com/hc/en-us/articles/21193881095565-AAS-offboarding-package) (AAS offboarding information) for offboarding support resources and sunset FAQs.

## adserver\_conversions\_with\_brand

The data source `adserver_conversions_with_brand` contains unattributed conversion activities measured by Amazon Ad Server Tag Manager and conversion activity pixels.

This data source includes the adserver brand association. It contains only conversion activities that were associated to brand(s). If conversion activity in the setup was associated to more than one brand, it will appear in multiple rows - one row per activity + brand association. Use the `conversion_id` field that represents the unique event identifier to remove duplicated conversions if you are analyzing all conversion data. Use this data source to analyze only conversions that were specifically assigned to one or more brands.
