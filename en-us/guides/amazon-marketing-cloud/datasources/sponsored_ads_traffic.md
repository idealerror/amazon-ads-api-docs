# Sponsored ads traffic

**Analytics table:** 

* `sponsored_ads_traffic`

**Audience table:** 

* `sponsored_ads_traffic_for_audiences`

This table contains impression events, click events, and video creative messages from Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored TV campaigns. There will be 1 record per sponsored ads impression event and 1 record per click event originated from a sponsored ads campaign.

You may use the ad_product_type field to filter these traffic events to the specific ad product they originated from. For example, records where `ad_product_type` has a value of `sponsored_products` are representative of Sponsored Products traffic events.

Example value: '325000'.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | NONE                  |

| unmeasurable\_viewable\_impressions | LONG      | METRIC           | Count of unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view events. Unmeasurable viewable and synthetic viewable events are estimated to be viewable, but could not be measured for viewability. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event) or '0' (if the record does not represent a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | NONE                  |
| user\_id                           | STRING    | DIMENSION        | Pseudonymous identifier that connects user activity across different events. The field can contain ad user IDs (representing Amazon accounts), device IDs, or browser IDs. NULL values appear when Amazon Ads is unable to resolve an identifier for an event. The field has a VERY\_HIGH aggregation threshold, meaning it cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used within Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for aggregation purposes like COUNT(DISTINCT user\_id).                                                                                                                                                          | VERY\_HIGH             |

AMC includes different types of user ID values, depending on whether the value represents a resolved Amazon account, a device, or a browser cookie. If Amazon Ads is unable to determine or provide an ID of any kind for a traffic event, the 'user\_id' and 'user\_id\_type' values for that record will be NULL. Possible values include: 'adUserId', 'sisDeviceId', 'adBrowserId', and NULL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | LOW                   |
