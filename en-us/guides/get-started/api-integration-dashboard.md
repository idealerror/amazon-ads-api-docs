# Monitor your API performance with the integration dashboard

The Amazon Ads API integration dashboard helps you monitor and improve your Ads API performance.

## Features

Use the dashboard metrics to analyze your Ads API performance, identify bottlenecks, and discover opportunities for API integration improvement. The dashboard has metrics like call volume, throttle rate, and error rates, and lets you break down data by dimensions like products, functions, API resources, and geography. You can look at daily, weekly, and monthly trends, and filter on specific API call subsets to identify inefficiencies. The dashboard also gives you an hourly breakdown so that you can identify when an error spike happened. 

The dashboard is built using [Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/using-dashboards.html). 

## Access the dashboard

When you sign into the Advanced Tools Center with an account that has access to the Ads API, you can access your dashboard from the **My Apps** tab in the navigation bar. 

If you have access to the Ads API but don't see a dashboard, your Amazon developer account may require Administrator or Developer [permissions](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/app-submission/manage-account-and-permissions.html).
