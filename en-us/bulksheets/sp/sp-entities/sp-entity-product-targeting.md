# Record Type: Product Targeting

A manual targeting campaign can have ad groups with either Keyword Targeting or Product Attribute Targeting but not both. Product Targeting is a new targeting mechanism for Sponsored Products. It allows advertisers to expand their targeting reach beyond the use of keywords. Advertisers can express intent for where the ads should appear based on the attributes of the product that they specify. 

With Product Targeting, you can use a combination of category and refinements available from the Amazon catalog to express the product pages where you want your ads to appear. Product Targeting offers granular targeting down to the level of specific product features, for example: category, brand, price, rating, or set of ASINs. These granular attributes that can be targeted are called ‘targeting clauses’ and are identified by a target ID.

As shown in [Sponsored Products Entity Hierarchy](bulksheets/sp/sp-entities/sp-entity-hierarchy), for manual Sponsored Products campaigns, i.e. campaigns with Campaign Targeting Type “Manual”, Product Attribute Targeting (PAT) and Negative Product Attribute Targeting (NPAT) can be enabled at an ad group level.

| 6      | Product Targeting ID | **Manual Product Targeting**: This field contains the product targeting expression. Every expression must contain an ASIN or a Category. A category can be further refined based on brand, product price (less than, between, greater than), review rating price (less than, between, greater than), prime shipping eligibility, age range and genre. One row can contain either one ASIN or one category. The category can be refined by one of more of the above attributes but with only one logical operator. In case there is a need to use more than one logical operator (e.g. product price is less than 10 or greater than 100), then two separate rows must be created in the bulksheet <br/> <br/> **Negative Targeting**: To exclude a brand or asin from a targeting expression, you can create a negative targeting expression in the same ad group as the positive targeting expression. Such expressions have a Row Type “Product Targeting” and Match Type “Negative Targeting Expression” <br/> <br/> **Automatic Targeting**: All auto-targeted campaigns come with enhanced targeting options, which are as follows:  <br/> <br/> _Close-match_: your ads will be shown to shoppers who use search terms closely related to your products  <br/> <br/> _Loose-match_: your ads will be to shown to shoppers who use search terms loosely related to your products <br/> <br/> _Substitutes_: your ads will be shown on detail pages of the substitutable products <br/> <br/> _Complements_: your ads will be shown on detail pages of products that complement your product  <br/> <br/> Due to a product limitation, users cannot use Bulksheets to setup automatic targeting but use Bulksheets to manage it. Users will need to setup auto targeting from the UI and then download the campaigns in a bulksheet. Doing so will create four additional rows in the downloaded bulksheet with Row Type “Product Targeting” and Match Type “Targeting Expression Predefined”, each corresponding to a targeting option (mentioned above). Users can then make edits to Status and Max Bid fields using bulksheet. | Required                                | For details on targeting expressions and samples, see the section [Product Attribute Targeting](bulksheets/sp/sp-general-info/sp-product-attribute-targeting) .                                                                                                                                                              | No      |
