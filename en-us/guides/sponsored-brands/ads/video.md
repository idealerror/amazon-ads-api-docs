# Video

This ad format features a horizontal or vertical video that tells your brand story or showcases an individual product or a collection of products. Video ads are eligible for mobile and desktop placements in shopping results.

See the [API reference for video](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsVideoAds) or the [API reference for brand video](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsBrandVideoAds).

##  Video vs. Brand video formats

If your goal is to drive conversion and purchases of an individual product, you can use the [video resource](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsVideoAds) to promote a single product and link that video to the product detail page. 

If your goal is to drive awareness and consideration, you can use the [brand video resource](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsBrandVideoAds) to promote your brand and link that video to your Store.

Under `Drive Page Visits` goal, brand video campaigns allow for one, two, or three advertised products. Under `Grow Brand Impression Share` goal, brand video campaigns allow for none, one, two, or three advertised products. In both advertising goals, you can use a horizontal or vertical video. If you are using a store as a landing page, the ASIN featured in the creative must also appear on your store landing page.

## Before you begin

Both types of campaigns require the following information:

* [A campaign ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#step-1-create-a-campaign)
* [An ad group ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#step-2-create-ad-group)
* Gather creative components
* Upload any needed assets using the [asset library API](guides/creative-asset/asset-library-overview)

## Examples

### Product detail landing page request

For product detail landing page video campaigns, you donâ€™t need to specify a landing page. Amazon uses the ASIN specified in the creative and directs customers that click on the ad directly to that product detail page. 

See API reference for [video](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsVideoAds).


```json
curl --location 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/sb/v4/ads/video' \

--header 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx' \
--header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope: xxxxxx' \

            "amzn1.assetlibrary.asset1.xxxxxx"
        ]
    }
}]
}
'
```

### Store landing page request

Brand video requires a `STORE` landing page type. Ensure the ASIN used in your creative is also featured on the Store page URL. You can check what ASINs are present on the page using the [GET /pageAsins endpoint](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#/Landing%20page%20asins/listAsins).

See API reference for [brand video](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi/prod#tag/Ads/operation/CreateSponsoredBrandsBrandVideoAds).

```json

        "headline": "The headline text of the product in the ad"
    }
}]
}
'
```

### Change to a new Store landing page from existing Brand video ad

The `POST sb/ads/creatives/brandVideo` endpoint changes an existing Brand video ad landing page to a new Store landing page. The `adId` parameter represents the id of the existing landing page. The creative object contains the details of the updated creative for the new landing page.
