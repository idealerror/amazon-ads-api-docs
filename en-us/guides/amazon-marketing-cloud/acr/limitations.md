# AMCâ€“AWS Clean Rooms limitations

The following list summarizes AMC-AWS Clean Rooms limitations:

## Query handling

When writing queries using collaboration data, the **AMC Query editor - date range** options are not supported.

- For querying over time ranges, make sure your data contains a time stamp column.
- Define the date range as part of the query.
- To restrict the date range in queries using advertiser connected data, use

```
  WHERE maineventtimecolumn >= BUILT_IN_PARAMETER('TIME_WINDOW_START') 
  AND maineventtimecolumn < BUILT_IN_PARAMETER('TIME_WINDOW_END').

```

> [NOTE] <`mainEventTimeColumn`> is the event time column on which the date range filter should apply.

Collaboration instances cannot query synthetic data.

## Query results

All results of your queries will go directly to the Amazon S3 bucket associated with your collaboration instance that you specified when creating a membership to join the collaboration.
Query results can be retrieved for queries run within the previous 90 days. To access results of queries executed prior to this 90-day period,  re-execute those queries.

## APIs

Schedules and workflow executions will not throw errors you make an API call prior to accepting the collaboration invite.
