# Amazon DSP views table

**Analytics table:** 

* `dsp_views`

**Audience table:** 

* `dsp_views_for_audiences`


This table represents all view events and all measurable events. Measurable events are from impression that were able to be measured. Viewable events represent events that met a viewable standard. The metric `viewable_impressions` is the count of viewable impressions using the IAB standard (50% of the impression's pixels were on screen for at least 1 second). Note the `dsp_views` table records a single impression more than one time if it is both measurable and viewable according to IAB's standards. An impression that is both measurable and viewable according to IAB's standards is recorded in one row as a measurable event and in another row as a viewable event. Note that while all impression events from `dsp_views` are recorded in `dsp_impressions`, not all impression events from `dsp_impressions` are recorded in `dsp_views` because not all impression events can be categorized as viewable, measurable or unmeasurable.

| event\_type                                | STRING      | DIMENSION        | Type of view event. There are four types of view events in AMC. Measurable impression events indicate that the Amazon Ads impression was able to be measured for viewability; these events can be summed using the measurable\_impressions metric. Viewable impression events indicate Amazon Ads determined the impression met MRC viewability standards; these events can be summed using the viewable\_impressions metric. Unmeasurable viewable and synthetic viewable impression events are estimated to be viewable; these events can be summed using the unmeasurable\_viewable\_impressions metric. Possible values include: 'MEASURABLE\_IMP' (measurable impression), 'VIEW' (viewable impression), 'UNMEASURABLE\_IMP' (unmeasurable viewable impression), and 'SYNTHETIC\_VIEW' (synthetic view impression). | LOW                   |

When querying this table, remember that each record represents one Amazon DSP view event, and a single impression may have more than one view event. Therefore, this field will not represent the exact count of impressions served by your campaigns. Since this table only includes views events, this field will always have a value of '1' (the event was a view event).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | NONE                  |
| impression\_id                             | STRING      | DIMENSION        | ID that connects related impression, view, click, and conversion events. For example, if an impression served has a request\_tag value of 'X', related view events will have have an impression\_id value of 'X'. All view events for a single impression will share a common impression\_id value. While this occurs infrequently, there are sometimes duplicate request\_tag values. As a result, it is not recommended to use request\_tag as a JOIN key without first grouping by it. Rather, it is a best practice to first consider using UNION ALL in a query instead of joining based on the request\_tag to combine data sources. For insights that involve user-level ad exposure across tables, use user\_id instead.                                                                                         | VERY\_HIGH            |

Measurable impression events indicate that the Amazon Ads impression was able to be measured for viewability. A single impression that is measurable could also be viewable, but not all measurable impressions are viewable. If an impression is both measurable and viewable, each event for the single impression is listed as a separate row. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a measurable impression) or '0' (if the record does not represent a measurable impression).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | NONE                  |

Unmeasurable viewable and synthetic viewable events are estimated to be viewable, but could not be measured for viewability. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event) or '0' (if the record does not represent a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | NONE                  |

The field can contain ad user IDs (representing Amazon accounts), device IDs, or browser IDs. NULL values appear when Amazon Ads is unable to resolve an identifier for an event. The field has a VERY\_HIGH aggregation threshold, meaning it cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used within Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for aggregation purposes like COUNT(DISTINCT user\_id).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | VERY\_HIGH            |

Possible values include: 'adUserId', 'sisDeviceId', 'adBrowserId', and NULL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | LOW                   |

| viewable\_impressions                      | LONG        | METRIC           | The count of impressions that were considered viewable. An impression is considered viewable when at least 50% of the ad's pixels are in view for at least one continuous second for display ads, or two continuous seconds for video ads. This is the Media Rating Council's (MRC) definition of viewability. Note that a single impression that is viewable has two events: a viewable impression and a measurable impression. Each event for the single impression is listed as a separate row. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a viewable impression) or '0' (if the record does not represent a viewable impression).                                                                                                                                                             | NONE                  |
