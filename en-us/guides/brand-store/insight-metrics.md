# Brand Store analytic metrics

Brand Store analytic metrics provide brands with analytics about the Brand Store performance and customer behavior. These metrics offer a deeper understanding of how shoppers interact with the Brand Store, helping brands optimize their strategies to drive engagement and sales.


## Before you begin

* Complete the Amazon Ads API [Onboarding](guides/onboarding/overview) and [Getting started](guides/get-started/overview) processes to obtain your access token and profile ID. You will need these to make all the calls referenced in the tutorial.
* Have a [brandEntityID.](guides/brand-store/overview#before-you-begin)



## Available insight metrics

>[NOTE] The insight metrics API allows fetching data for a date range spanning up to 100 days, where the difference between the start date and end date cannot exceed 100 days.


Below is a table of all the available insight metrics that can be used to retrieve Brand Store performance:


|Insight metric	|Description	|
|---	|---	|
|VIEWS	|Number of page views. `VIEW` metric can be aggregated by all dimensions.	|
|ORDERS	|Estimated total orders placed by Store visitors within 14 days of their visit. Orders contain one or more units sold. `ORDERS` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions.	|
|UNITS	|Estimated units purchased by Store visitors within 14 days of their last visit. `UNITS` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions.	|
|SALES	|Estimated total sales generated by Store visitors within 14 days of their last visit. `SALES` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions.	|
|VISITS	|Total visits to a page within a single day. Each visitor can visit more than one page, and they can visit your Store from more than one traffic source. `VISITS` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions.	|
|VISITORS	|Total visitors to your Store within the selected date range, calculated based on daily unique users or devices. One visitor can visit more than one page, and they can visit your Store from more than one traffic source. `VISITORS` metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension `DATE`. Users won't be able to get this metric when specifying other dimensions. This is because number of visitors are measured at store level. This also means this metric won't be impacted by the InsightFilter.	|
|SCORE_LEVEL	|Store Quality rating calculated on various factors defining the quality of a store. It can be HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. This metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension.	|
|RECOMMENDATIONS	|An array of objects containing two fields: recommendedAction (e.g., "Add a video") and observedAverageDwellTimeIncrease (the improvement it would bring in the overall store quality).	|
|CONTRIBUTORS	|An array of recommendations applied by the Store Owner resulting in the improvement of overall store quality. This metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension.	|
|DWELL	|Average time a customer spends on the store, specifically for store quality measurement. This metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension.	|
|PEER_DWELL	|Average time a customer spends on other similar (peer) stores on average. This metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension.	|
|DWELL_TIME	|Average time a customer spends on the store, providing insights into user engagement by calculating the average duration of visits. `DWELL_TIME` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions or at the store level. For aggregation at store level, dimension must be omitted from the request.	|
|BOUNCE_RATE	|Ratio of total bounce visits (customer who landed on the store and left quickly without engaging) to total landing visits, providing insights into visitor engagement. `BOUNCE_RATE` metric can be aggregated by all the dimensions or at the store level. For aggregation at store level, dimension must be omitted from the request.	|
|NEW\_TO\_STORE	|Total count of unique visitors who are new to the store, providing valuable insights into the number of first-time shoppers. `NEW_TO_STORE` metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension or at the store level. For aggregation at store level, dimension must be omitted from the request.	|

## Available ASIN metrics

>[NOTE] `ASIN` dimension must be omitted from request when using the `TOTAL_VIEWS` or `TOTAL_CLICKS` metrics.

## Quality and recommendations metrics

Brand Store quality and recommendations metrics focus on a Brand Store’s average dwell time, how you compare to your peer groups on Amazon, your Store quality rating, and a list of recommended actions you can take to improve your Store’s quality and performance. 

A high rating means that you’ve taken actions that Amazon believes will increase the duration that shoppers spend on your Store (dwell time). We use your Store rating to recommend specific actions that may help improve your Store performance and dwell time.

Below is a table of the quality and recommendations metrics: 

 >[NOTE] These metrics can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension. 

|Metric	|Description	|
|---	|---	|
|SCORE_LEVEL	|Store Quality rating calculated on various factors defining the quality of a store. It can be HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. This metric currently can only be aggregated by the `DATE` dimension.	|
|RECOMMENDATIONS	|An array of objects containing two fields: recommendedAction (e.g., "Add a video") and observedAverageDwellTimeIncrease (the improvement it would bring in the overall store quality).	|
|CONTRIBUTORS	|An array of recommendations applied by the Store Owner resulting in the improvement of overall store quality. This metric currently can only be aggregated by `DATE` dimension. 	|
|DWELL	|Average time a customer spends on the store, specifically for store quality measurement. This metric currently can only be aggregated by `DATE` dimension. 	|
|PEER_DWELL	|Average time a customer spends on other similar (peer) stores on average. This metric currently can only be aggregated by `DATE` dimension. 	|
