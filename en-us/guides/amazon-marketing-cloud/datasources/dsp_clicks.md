The platform fee (also known as the technology fee or console fee in other contexts) is calculated as a percentage of the supply cost. To convert to dollars/your currency, divide by 100,000,000 (e.g., 100,000,000 microcents = $1.00). Refer to the currency\_name field for the currency in which the impression was purchased.

Postal code is also referred to as "zip code" in the US. The postal code is prepended with the iso\_country\_code value (e.g. 'US'). If the country is known, but the postal code is unknown, only the country code will be populated in postal\_code.

For example, if an impression served has a request\_tag value of 'X', related conversion events will have have an impression\_id value of 'X'. While this occurs infrequently, there are sometimes duplicate request\_tag values. As a result, it is not recommended to use request\_tag as a JOIN key without first grouping by it. Rather, it is a best practice to first consider using UNION ALL in a query instead of joining based on the request\_tag to combine data sources. For insights that involve user-level ad exposure across tables, use user\_id instead. | VERY\_HIGH            |

A site can be any digital property where ads are served, including websites, mobile apps, and streaming platforms. Note that different types of environments may have different formatting. For example, 'widgets.com' for a web property, 'Widgets iOS (ID: 1234567890)' for an app property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | LOW                   |

Above the fold (ATF) refers to the portion of the webpage visible without scrolling, while below the fold (BTF) refers to the portion that requires scrolling to view. This dimension helps measure where ad impressions were served on the page. Possible values include: 'ATF', 'BTF', and 'UNKNOWN'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | LOW                   |

To convert supply\_cost to dollars/your local currency, divide by 100,000,000 (e.g., 100,000,000 microcents = $1.00). Refer to the currency\_name field for the currency in which the impression was purchased.

The field can contain ad user IDs (representing Amazon accounts), device IDs, or browser IDs. NULL values appear when Amazon Ads is unable to resolve an identifier for an event. The field has a VERY\_HIGH aggregation threshold, meaning it cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used within Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for aggregation purposes like COUNT(DISTINCT user\_id).                                                                                                                                                             | VERY\_HIGH            |

If Amazon Ads is unable to determine or provide an ID of any kind for a click event, the 'user\_id' and 'user\_id\_type' values for that record will be NULL. Possible values include: 'adUserId', 'sisDeviceId', 'adBrowserId', and NULL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | LOW                   |
