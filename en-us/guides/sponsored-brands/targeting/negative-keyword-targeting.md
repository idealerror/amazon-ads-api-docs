# Sponsored Brands negative keyword targeting

Negative keywords prevent your keyword targeted ads from displaying when a shopperâ€™s shopping queries match your negative keywords. You can use negative keywords to exclude poorly performing keywords. This can help reduce your advertising cost and help increase your return on ad spend (ROAS). Negative keyword targeting can be used at the ad group level which will affect any ads under that specific ad group. 

Visit the support console for more information on [negative product targeting](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G8W49VU65XQ4T2NS).

If you don't know what keywords to target, try using [negative keyword recommendations](sponsored-brands/3-0/openapi#tag/Negative-keywords/operation/listNegativeKeywords) resource to get a list of negative keywords.

## Before you begin

* [A campaign ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#Create-a-campaign)
* [An ad group ID](guides/sponsored-brands/campaigns/get-started-with-campaigns#Create-ad-group)
