# Access tokens

As explained in the [Authorization Overview](guides/account-management/authorization/overview), a successful call to the Amazon Ads API requires an advertiser to explicitly grant authorization to a client application to access the advertiser's data and services. 

This authorization process is handled by the [Login with Amazon (LwA)](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/documentation-overview.html) service using access tokens. In any call to the Amazon Ads API, the access token represents a specific advertiser's consent for a specific client to access the advertiser's data and services.

In the following diagram, the client application retrieves an access token from the Login with Amazon server using an authorization code:

![OAuth 2.0 in the Amazon Ads API](/_images/setting-up/advertising_api_auth_flow.png)

Access tokens are valid for 60 minutes. During this time, an access token serves as a credential to access the advertiser's resources through the Amazon Ads API.

## Authorization servers

Access tokens can be retrieved from any of three regional Login with Amazon hosts:

| Region | Authorization URL |
|--------|-----|
| North America (NA) | https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token |
| Europe (EU) | https://api.amazon.co.uk/auth/o2/token |
| Far East (FE) | https://api.amazon.co.jp/auth/o2/token |

Access tokens are global. An access token retrieved from any of the hosts above is a valid credential for the Amazon Ads API in any region.

## Retrieving access tokens

To retrieve an access token, a Login with Amazon client application provides a **client ID**, a **client secret**, and *one* of the following:

- An **authorization code** generated by the advertiser using the [authorization grant process](guides/account-management/authorization/authorization-grants).
- A **refresh token** retrieved from a previous successful access token request.

For step-by-step instructions on identifying the client ID and client secret of your Login with Amazon application, see our [Onboarding Walkthrough](guides/onboarding/overview).

### Retrieving an access token using an authorization code

To retrieve access and refresh tokens using an authorization code, the client calls a Login with Amazon host using the following query parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| grant_type | Must be `authorization_code`.  |
| code | The authorization code retrieved through the authorization grant process. Note this code expires after 5 minutes. |
| redirect_uri | One of the values in the **Allowed Return URLs** field in your Login with Amazon account. |
| client_id | The **Client ID** of the Login with Amazon account. |
| client_secret | The **Client Secret** of the Login with Amazon account. |

For example, to retrieve access and refresh tokens using cURL, substitute your values in the following request:

```shell
curl  \
    -X POST \
    --data "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_RETURN_URL&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token  
```

>[NOTE]Authorization codes expire after 5 minutes. An authorization code may be used once to retrieve access and refresh tokens.

### Generating an access token using a refresh token

Once tokens have been retrieved using an authorization code, a new access token can be retrieved at any time using the refresh token. To use a refresh token, the client calls a Login with Amazon host using the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| grant_type | Must be `refresh_token`.  |
| refresh_token | The `refresh_token` value returned from a successful token request. |
| client_id | The **Client ID** of your Login with Amazon account. |
| client_secret | The **Client Secret** of your Login with Amazon account. |

For example, to retrieve a new access token using cURL, substitute your values in the following request:

```shell
curl \
    -X POST \
    --data "grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token
```

>[NOTE] A refresh token remains valid until the user who granted authorization revokes the authorization. After a successful request using a refresh token, the same refresh token is returned along with a new access token.

## Access token response

The response to a successful token request is a JSON object with the following schema:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| access_token | The access token. |
| token_type | The type of OAuth 2.0 token. Always set to `bearer`. |
| expires_in | The length of time until the access token expires, in seconds.|
| refresh_token | The refresh token. |

For example:

```JSON
{
    "access_token": "Atza|IQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0U-Dme37rR6CuUpSR...",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "Atzr|IQEBLzAtAhRPpMJxdwVz2Nn6f2y-tpJX2DeX..."
}
```

Note that access tokens are valid for 60 minutes. A new access token can be generated at any time using the refresh token. Refresh tokens do not expire.

 Access tokens begin with the characters `Atza|`, and refresh tokens begin with `Atzr|`. These characters are part of the token and should be included wherever the token is used.

- For information about error responses to LwA authorization requests, see [Access Token Errors](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#access-token-errors).

## Using access tokens in the Amazon Ads API

A valid access token must be included in the `Authorization` header for any successful call to the Amazon Ads API. The token is appended to the string `"Bearer "` and passed as a single string.

For example, the access token `"Atza|IQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0U-Dme37rR6CuUpSR..."` would result in the following header:

```shell
Authorization: "Bearer Atza|IQEBLjAsAhRmHjNgHpi0U-Dme37rR6CuUpSR..."
```

- For a list of required authorization headers in the Amazon Ads API, see the [Authorization Overview](guides/account-management/authorization/overview#required-authorization-headers).

## Access token concepts

- An access token enables a client application to access a specific advertiser's data and services via the Amazon Ads API.
- A current access token must be included in the `Authorization` header in any request to the Amazon Ads API.
- A client can retrieve an access token for a given advertiser using either:
    - An authorization code retrieved from the advertiser via the authorization grant process.
    - A refresh token returned along with an earlier successful access token request.
- Access tokens are valid for 60 minutes.
- Refresh tokens do not expire.
