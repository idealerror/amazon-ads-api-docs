# Invoices

Use the [invoices API](billing#tag/invoice) to retrieve advertising invoices that include the total amount due, the amount of taxes due, and other billing-related information. To use this API, the user that granted permission for the access token must have the necessary permissions as specified in the [Amazon Ads API permissions reference](guides/account-management/permissions).

## Retrieving advertising invoices using Amazon Ads API

Amazon Ads API provides APIs to retrieve the invoices of an advertising account. There are three high level steps in retrieving your invoices using Amazon Ads API.

1.	Retrieve your accountsâ€™ Amazon Ads [Profile IDs](guides/account-management/authorization/profiles)
2.	Retrieve your invoice summaries
3.	Retrieve your invoice details

This process requires a client ID, client secret, and a refresh token. If you're not familiar with creating these, please see the [getting started guide](guides/get-started/overview). 

## Retrieve your profile IDs

Profiles in the Amazon Ads API represent an advertiser's account in a specific marketplace. Advertisers may have a single profile if they advertise in only one marketplace, or a separate profile for each marketplace if they advertise regionally or globally. Profiles in the Amazon Ads API correspond to accounts in the Amazon Ads console. A separate account is established for each marketplace. A single user (the advertiser) may manage multiple accounts in the console or through the API with the same Amazon login credentials.

Profiles IDs are required to retrieve the list of invoice summaries. The list of profile ids can be retrieved using a [/v2/profiles](2/profiles#tag/Billing-Notifications/operation/bulkGetBillingNotifications) API call. This call requires the `Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId` header parameter. 

This call to the profiles API retrieves a list of profiles:

#### Sample request from /v2/profiles:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/v2/profiles'\ 
     --header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId:xxxxxxxxxx'\
     --header 'Authorization: xxxxxxx'
```


#### Sample response from /v2/profiles:
 
```json
[
    { 
        "profileId": 777777777, 
        "countryCode": "CA", 
        "currencyCode": "CAD", 
        "timezone": "AmericaiLos_Angeles", 
        "accountInfo": 
        { 
            "marketplaceStringid": "A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2", 
            "id": "ENTITY2Plqweuieorf",
            "type": "vendor", 
            "name": "Name of the Account", 
            "validPaymentMethod": false 
        } 
    },
    { 
        "profileId": 888888888, 
        "countryCode": "MX", 
        "currencyCode": "MXN", 
        "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", 
        "accountInfo": 
        { 
            "marketplaceStringId": "A1AM78C64UM0Y8", 
            "id": "ENTITY2Ihjasdjkeru", 
            "type": "vendor", 
            "name": "Name of the Account", 
            "validPaymentMethod": false },   
    }
]
```

## Retrieve your invoice summaries

The [/invoices API](billing#tag/invoice/operation/getAdvertiserInvoices) provides a list of invoice summaries for the given profile id. The profile ID from /v2/profiles API call must be used as the `Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope` header parameter for the invoices API call.

#### Sample call to /invoices:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/invoices' \
     --header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId:xxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
     --header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope:xxxxxxxxxxx' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer Atza|xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

#### Sample response from /invoices:

```json
{
    "status": "success", 
    "payload": {
        "nextCursor": "xysd",
        "invoiceSummaries": [
        {
            "id": "ID-234",
            "status": "WRITTEN_OFF", 
            "fromDate": "20240304", 
            "toDate": "20240305", 
            "invoiceDate": "20240304",
            "amountDue": {
                "amount": 66.67,
                "currencyCode": "USD"
            },
            "taxAmount Due": {
                "amount": 0.0,
                "currencyCode": "USD"
            },
            "remainingAmount Due": {
                "amount": 0.0,
                "currencyCode": "USD"
            },
            "remainingTax Amount Due": {
                "amount": 0.0,
                "currencyCode": "USD"
            },
            "fees": [],
            "remainingFees": [],
            "downloadable Documents": [
                "INVOICE"
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

## Retrieve your invoice details

The [/invoices/{invoiceId}](billing#tag/invoice/operation/getAdvertiserInvoices) API provides details for the invoice with the given `invoiceId`. Pass the `id` field from the invoice summary as the `invoiceId`.

#### Sample call to /invoices/{invoiceId}

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://advertising-api.amazon.com/invoices/{invoiceId}'\ 
     --header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId:xxxxxxxxx'\ 
     --header 'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope:xxxxxxxxxxx'\
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer Atza|xxxxxxxxxxx'
```
